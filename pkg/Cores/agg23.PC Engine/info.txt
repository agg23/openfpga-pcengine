Port by agg23. Core by Gregory Estrade, srg320, and greyrogue

PC Engine (PCE), known as TurboGrafx-16 in the United States, was created by NEC and was the first 4th generation console to reach the market. Therefore, even though it came out in the late 80s, it has significantly better graphics than 8-bit systems that were being sold at the time, such as the NES.

Currently supports standard PC Engine/TurboGrafx and SuperGrafx ROMs. CD support is coming sometime in the future. Please report all issues to agg23, as most likely any issues experienced are issues with the port, not the core.
